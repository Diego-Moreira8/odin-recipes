      This is a recipe that we have made in our family for many years. Everyone
      loves it. It's a very basic and easy variation on mac 'n cheese.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 10 minutes. Scoop out some of the cooking water and reserve.
        Drain spaghetti.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and pepper;
        cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spaghetti and Pecorino
        Romano cheese. Ladle in 1/2 cup of reserved cooking water; stir until
        cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Add more cooking water until sauce
        coats spaghetti, about 1 minute more.
      </li>
    </ol>
